## Getting Started

> **DO NOT CLONE OR FORK**

If you want to set up this template:

1. Request a repository on SnapEnv GitHub by following the standard procedure on the wiki. It will install the template directly. Alternatively, set it up in your personal GitHub account by clicking **[Use this template](https://github.com/snapenv/snap-package-template/generate)**.
2. Wait until the first run of CI finishes. Github Actions will commit to your new repo with a "refactor: üéâ Ready to clone and code." message.
3. Uset git to clone your new repository.
4. Delete optional files: 
    - If you don't need automatic documentation generation, you can delete folder `docs`, `mkdocs-overrides`, file `.github\workflows\github-pages-dev.yml`, `.github\workflows\reusable-github-pages.yml` and `mkdocs.yml`
    - If you don't want automatic testing, you can delete folder `tests` and file `.github\workflows\test.yml`
5. Prepare a virtual environment and test:
```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
ENVIRONMENT=dev poe api --dev
```
6. Adapt anything else to your project. 
7. Read the file [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) for more information about development of your server.
